# Shemetz Macros - a custom FoundryVTT module for my play group

This module includes a lot of random stuff.  I constantly add (and sometimes edit or remove) stuff here, so don't expect
it to be stable, not that you should, because it's made for my own use.  You can probably find some good source code for
some things here, though!  And if you ask me I could export some of the things here into their own modules.

## New keybindings

#### [Eyedropper / Color Pick](scripts/drawing/eyedropper-color-pick.js)
Press and release K while using the drawing tools to pick a color directly from the screen.
A preview will be shown while you hold K.  You can also hold Shift to affect fill color instead of stroke color, and
you can hold Alt to pick a color from the scene's background image instead of the screen (ignoring lighting, drawings, 
grid, etc).

## New UI controls
#### [Close wall gaps](scripts/walls/close-wall-gaps.js)
![close wall gaps screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699750150674972743/888549704403664906/unknown.png)

A button in the Walls controls allows you to automatically find and fix all "wall gaps" - places where two walls have
their endpoints almost at the same place, off by a small number of pixels.  This will show you a preview and a count of
how many gaps are about to be closed.

#### [Enable "End Turn" button in chat bar](scripts/gui/end-turn-button-in-chat-bar.js)
![end turn button screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/729279512470093914/942007679965069382/end_turn_button.png)

An extra button to end your turn, shown on the bottom of the chat tab during combat.


#### Everything Else
- A lot of code, used by my macros and other macros in my group's campaigns
- A lot of macros in the compendium which already use much of this code
- A critical hits tables compendium, used by the Critical Hit Tables macro (for D&D 5e)

Previously many of these macros were meant to be called from other macros, via the Furnace or Advanced Macros modules.
However, this is now mostly unnecessary, as the important code is moved into the module itself.  Many of the functions
can be directly called by typing `ShemetzMacros.nameOfFunction()`.
